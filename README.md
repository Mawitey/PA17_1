# Comparing Classifiers
Here is link to the notebook - https://github.com/Mawitey/PA17_1/blob/main/practical%20assignment%203.ipynb

###  Problem statement
This project compares multiple machine learning models to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (binary classification: yes or no) based on personal, economic, and campaign-related data. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Bank Marketing Data Set.

### Results
LogisticRegression has 91% test accuracy, while knn has 90% test accuracy. Decision tree has 88.77% test accuracy while SVC has 89.45% test accuracy.
### Findings
Logistic Regression had the best performance overall with high accuracy and fast training time. Decision Trees were the most interpretable but slightly overfit. KNN required tuning but performed well. Feature scaling was critical for SVM and Logistic Regression.

### Next steps
Next I will try to deploy the best performing model, so I can have an end to end working model.
